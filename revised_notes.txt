MDN doc , for original from ECMAscript .

why different Extensions ?
with some extension , software(compiler or interpreter) will know what syntax means. 

initially , JS was written on the web browsers and software was not common.
we will use the NODE js to LEARN JS.

JS is interpreted.

TERMINAL Query :
1) node -v :: to see node version
2) node folder_name/file_name.js :: to interpret code.

VARIABLE'S AND CONSTANT'S
 const keyword for constants.
 let or var keyword for variables.
 even without let or var , we can declare variables.
 (recommended : to use 'let' for variables only)

TO PRINT OUTPUT :
    console.log(variable_name);
    console.table([variable1 ,var2 , var3 , ..]);
        it will print in the table with column names as index and values.
        in the matrix.
